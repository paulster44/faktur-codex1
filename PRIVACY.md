# Privacy Notice

Faktur stores all business data locally on the device using an on-device SQLite database managed by Drift. No analytics, telemetry, or remote synchronization is performed. Sensitive values, such as the optional encryption passphrase, are stored in the platform keychain when available.

Because data never leaves the device, users are responsible for their own backups. Manual export tools are available from the Settings screen for JSON/CSV/PDF bundles.
